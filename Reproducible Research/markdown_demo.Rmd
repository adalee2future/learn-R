My first R Markdown File
=========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and templature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```


Here's an unordered list

* first element

* second element
